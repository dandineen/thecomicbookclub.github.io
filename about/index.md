Founded in 2015 and inspired by the book club that my wife is part of, I ([@chao_xian](https://twitter.com/chao_xian)) decided to start up a Comic Book Club with a few of those local to me who I know are fellow comic book geeks.

## Club rules

Some of this is cribbed from [Radio 4's guide to running a bookclub](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/book-club/running-a-club/)

* The first rule is...
* Keep membership small (at the moment that's very easy), ideally 8
* Chit chat for 15-20 minutes before Club begins
* Host arranges data ASAP
* Host picks book in advance
* Host picks venue
* Host chairs the club session
* We take turns being Host
* Budget of ~Â£15 max
* Ideally something none of us have read, or at the very least not read for many years
* You can buy digital or World of Things version to read
* Think of 3 points about the book you want to say and bring it along
* Plus a sentence on whether you liked it and why
* It would be helpful to write these down to be collated
* Give it a score out of 5
* Repeat once a month!

The last few will be curated into reviews on this site :bowtie:
