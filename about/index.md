Founded in 2015 and inspired by the book club that my wife is part of, I ([@chao_xian](https://twitter.com/chao_xian)) decided to start up a Comic Book Club with a few of those local to me who I know are fellow comic book geeks.

## Members

* [@chao_xian](https://twitter.com/chao_xian)
* [@dandineen](https://twitter.com/dandineen)
* [@realstephens](https://twitter.com/realstephens) (waiting in the wings)

## Club rules

Some of this is cribbed from [Radio 4's guide to running a bookclub](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/book-club/running-a-club/), plus [Bleeding Cool's guide](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/26/how-to-create-a-graphic-novel-book-club-sdcc-and-cbldf-tell-you-how/) (via [@tomwe](https://twitter.com/tomwe)):

* The first rule is... you do no talk about the comic book we're reading before the club meet
* Keep membership *very* small
* The entire club has to approve any proposed new members
* Members have to *love* comics, be friends and be nice
* It is a *club*, not a tweetup - you can't just come along
* Chit chat for 15-20 minutes before Club begins
* Host arranges date ASAP
* Host picks book in advance
* Host picks venue
* Host chairs the club session
* When it's someone's turn to speak, try not to interrupt
* If you have a salient point to make during someone else's turn, keep it short
* It's Host's role to move things along from an interruption
* We take turns being Host
* Budget of ~Â£15 max
* It has to be available to buy from a retailer - not just eBay and definitely not just from torrents
* You can buy digital or a hardcopy version to read
* Ideally something none of us have read, or at the very least not read for many years
* Think of 3 points about the book you want to say and bring it along
* Plus a sentence on whether you liked it and why
* It would be helpful to write these down
* Give it a score out of 5
* Host should do a write-up for this site, following current format
* People are welcome to write elsewhere about our meetups but please link back to us
* Repeat once a month!

The last few will be curated into reviews on this site :bowtie:
