The (Western?) World's first Chinese superhero! Gene Luen Yang creates an origin story for a forgotten, subversive character from the Golden Age. The Green Turtle! It's fair to say that he has found a golden nugget from that era.

*AUTHORS NOTE: I am embarrassingly behind on write ups. The others have kept up pretty well but I've spent the past year just not bothering. So here is a listicle version of everyone's thoughts on the book. These are the literal notes from the night, which I've edited for any faux pas.*

[![Classic]({{site.url}}/images/comic/shadow-hero/classic.jpg)]({{site.url}}/images/comic/shadow-hero/classic.jpg)

## Jake

* Felt quite grounded.
* People who become superheroes.
* Breath of fresh air and uncynical compared to Mark Millar.
* Didn't know any background - a mystery until the end.
* Doesn't need the revival story - works as it's own thing.
* Felt like a story working for itself.
* Funny.
* Great characterisation.
* Loved his mother.
* Not a character you see in comics much.
* Family relationship: heavy on that like Ms Marvel.
* Bit cartoonish, didn't love the art but didn't put me off.
* Serves the story.
* The whole sequence of pushing the boy into chemical concoctions - funny.
* Thing not normally fond of.
* Gangster thing again not one of my favourite things. Don't like them...
* ...but in the background. Father gets killed and he turns into a super turtle.
* An uninteresting character but didn't need whistles and bells.
* Liked him - innocent.
* Fight scenes with tortoise giving instructions - brilliant/great.
* Having read the 40s character and the struggle of it being Chinese...
* ...looking back over treatment, seeing the back a lot and similarities.
* A really sweet thing.
* Hope it's a standalone.
* Series of 5 issues is enough.
* Loved setting of 40s World.
* Brought it to life.
* Cute romance but not necessary.
* Not a lot to say really.
* Read in one lunch time - easy.
* Unexpected and quite pleasurable.

## Dan

* A lot like Jake...not a massive amount... not because awful or hated it.
* When I looked at it, wondered whether I would connect.
* Remarkably accessible.
* Extremely funny in some parts.
* Not lol'd at things that are culturally different just funny situations - witty.
* Art - not my scene.
* Chew - people very much like the same in that.
* Interested to know from anyone who insight into Chinese families if the archetypes are real or how much blown out of proportion?
* An archetype that must exist for a reason.
* A lovely, unlovable woman.
* Father loves her genuinely.
* The kung fu uncle loves her.
* Son does even she is weird and stand offish.
* As long as not through a lens that is weird for people not aware of it...
* ...as in I map my own experiences to it, like in divorcing parents I cannot stand infidelity.
* But relationships here are so unfamiliar that I'm forced to look at it from outside.
* Bizarre why he puts up with her - no emotional feedback but still devoted.
* Making her smile but is heartbreaking.
* Jake says that felt really real: drawn on something.
* Honest, not stretching too far or too clever.
* A yarn with a different spin.
* Fave: "She's talking about his testicles..."
* "Really made me want to watch Big Trouble In Little China which can only be a really good thing".
* What's with the obsession about the mother's bosom?!?

> Really interesting little thing. Didn't stress. Didn't want to burn it which is usually how I feel about Kelv's books...

## Tom

* I would've read it again myself... except Kelv had to borrow my copy!
* Missed first time: we see the Dad's shadow, Turtle fulfilling the promise.
* Interested to read it.
* Both creators have books on Tom's list.
* I think this is fantastic.
* Boxer's and Saints - I will definitely go and read.
* Charlie Chan's Art of Hok Chye.
* Hadn't heard of this one.
* Thoroughly enjoyed it.
* Really do have an issue with the big heads.
* Will follow up on writer but not artist.
* Just a style thing, calms down to a degree, settles on just the Mum.
* A little too close to Rob Gilroy's Chew which most of us don't like.
* Only the art holding Tom back
* Read in 2 passes, as most of us - wanted to read it.
* Not been able to watch much telly, but more time to read and this one was wanted.
* Great touches how bullets scoot around.
* Despite disliking how he designs people, storytelling approach is very good.
* Dad death is a full page panel.
* It's dense yet reads really, really easily.
* Jake loves all the silhouette work.
* Wondered if the Tiger spirit is in the mother (Me: "No...!")
* Even though the dragon has a nice rivalry, the others weren't needed.
* 40s types superhero archetypes.
* Really, really thoroughly enjoyed it.

## Me

* Art and culture feel genuine.
* Tiger mum - hateful.
* Humbleness isn't a thing.
* Hate how she treats son and husband.
* Pride makes her horrible.
* Genuine feelings.
* Real calligraphy.
* Easy to read.
* Back story intriguing. Love the subversiveness.
