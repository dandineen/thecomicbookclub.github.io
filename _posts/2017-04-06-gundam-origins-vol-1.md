They say you should never judge a book by its cover but wow look at this one. It illicits a wistful excitement in me rooted from a time long ago and far, far away.

Never heard of it. Thought it looked familiar. Is this Transformers then realised it predates Transformers.

Colours beautiful. Arresting even in black and white. Then really quickly couln't work out what was going on in the space battles

Is it the genre and I'm not able to fill the spaces?

Didn't follow it very to an extent

Couldn't tell spaceships apart or even the robots.

(black and white)

Breath of fresh air back in colour.

Didn't realise they weren't on Earth until the end. Must have not taken in the intro that explained "sides" but read it late in the night.

Battlestar Galactica plot.

Partly not concentraing - but when I do that there's a reason. Disinterest in the story. Familiar.

The characters didn't really engage. Didn't realise the protagonist was related to the guy who designed the RX-78. Re-read it to give it another chance, but no. I'm not a giant robot kind of guy.

A few bits I did like - incl. the baddy (Char). The plucky nurse hard ass girl and she's dazzled by his beauty when he takes off his helmet.

Dunno if intentionally amusing but it was superb.

I thought it was an attractive book and happily look at it. The main robot I like the look of him.  Liked the lightsabers and would've like to see more battles with that.

Wondered if this normal of manga - bits of their face missing (white shadows) liked that

Liked the lettering, sound effects - quite cool

Dead cool

Had it all been in colour I would've enjoyed it in all colour.

Probably great as a cartoon.

Bits I whipped through - what slowed me down was the text. The sentences are broken up, probably the translation plus getting your head into reading the book "backwards".

Getting into the lift with the uptight JR Lieutenant - the staccato text suited. But other bits hammy, badly translated. Felt like Google Translate job.

Got 1/2 way through today and didn't think much better. Appreciated the artwork still. Didn't do enough to pull me in. It's a beautiful thing, a beautiful book.

Giant robots not for me. There were no farting sharks.

Robots fighting in space and the whole physics of it doesn't make sense to me. Like they're fighting on solid ground.

Is it my problem with giant robots or men in suits bursting around in space.

Maybe if they'd been in New York

Really, really confusing - really lost with what the hell was going on. Kept going back and seeing where people are spatially in relation to other people. Struggled with scale. I thought the robots at the beginning were small.

I thought the RX-78 was giant and they were small but then when they fought I was confused.

All the way through struggled with scale.

Maybe it's the styling - struggled how to tell characters apart. Just a bit funny on that one. That threw me out. Found it quite hard to read compared to Gyo.

Took longer.

Some of the art is absolutely gorgeous and looks absolutely amazing. but I wanted to understand what was going on

some people on the good ship that got into the Guntanks - yeah cool I liked the things but I don't know what?

Vague summary of confusion. Right at the start I thought it was going to go 2 shades of grey and one side founded from the Earth Federation and the other are Zeon - which one are the Zeon? Are they on the tubey thing? Until somebody says.

Could be good as a dark military story and quite hard hitting war story and in some cases it was but then red ferret with his super cape turns up and I couldn't stop laughing

conforms to prett much everything - Battle of Planets and Starfleet which formed the shape of what I understnad of these things

flamboyant massive super capes, funny eyes and heltmets

little bit vaguely sad not something dark and gritty and pantomime villain

instead of a REbellion and succession

was hoping to not know who to root for - maybe the Zeon should win!

Amuro - don't care

girl's mum gets killed

explosion and thrown forward

old captain died - but provides good solid advice to privileged nobber - then why am I rooting for this side?

I was quite sad when he died I tgouht he was pretty cool. Would've liked to see him kick some ass

Art was varied

Some not particularly spectacular to truly spectacular - it feels like it's of its time although it's like Star Wars it drawn as the future and cool but you can feel that it was done in the late 70s/80s

not a fan of the primary colour space robots

made it feel like a toyline and give it a story

lovely format absolutely beautiful book but hard to hold and would've loved it at half the size

the word balloons are hard work when they obvs have limited space

the top to bottom words - nothing you could've done

it didn't help

sentence broken up but forgetting which way it goes was confusing (see pg 158)

Pretty much with Jake. Found it longer to read because trickier. I enjoyed it. Didn't think it wsa rubbish at all but not intrigued/engaged enough to read more. The Gundam striding was amaze-balls. Serious skills.

A solid ⭐⭐⭐ I will not be burning it or throwing out the window as I'm driving through Sally In The Woods.

## Tom

As a fan of big robots in general having grown up with TF I enjoyed it a lot.

Was looking forward to it haven't never read or wathced anything of Gundam to know how it differes to any of the others

Robotech came before didn't it? (nope)

REad the colour bit first looked really nice

remind me of being quite atypical of a science fiction setting "cylinder world" seen that in other things Rendezvous with Rama (AC CLarke)

2000AD "Brink" earth died, crates in space - pretty much this design

Image - The Fuse

Halo Jones - tubes in space

Same problem had no idea the first suits were big

only when you start punching them - sword comes through, oh it's the same scale bit of a disconnect

enjoyed the story and characters as it went along

standard sterotypical characters

Surprised Frau didn't get into too much trouble

subtly different from "girls in peril" or "upskirt"

well restrained

I also had the issue of understanding what was going on but only the spacey bits when trying to launch the shuttle but something went wrong

but I just carried on - but I'm much more forgiving

there are sections where the art's less well polished

I didn't even pick up on the "unfinished face" so I must be quite used it

fantastic moment when he takes off his helmet "What? Is he her brother?"

At the end his beautiful sister?

the strong female is really unusual

I definitely came away having enjoyed it more than these two

right hand problem (again with the "backwards"!)

⭐⭐⭐⭐ as a fan of big robots and it really hit the spot
