Manu is definitely an indie book.

From the dinky but lovely A6 format, to the 'buy it direct from the artist' and the personal salutations on the inside cover everything about Manu (and its sibling books Lima and Trujillo) scream self-published passion project.

For some unknown reason I don’t buy indies. Although I may have felt like I was pushing back against 'the big two' the late-80s by buying Dark Horse and Comico, I was never really one for titles and publishers that were a little more&hellip; rough around the edges, a little weirder than my usual tastes.

I haven’t changed that much over the years. My pull-list is pretty much all Image (who’d have thought it!) and the odd Marvel or DC book. I’m a creature of habit really.

## Suprise Motherf**ker!

Manu started as an interesting curve ball to throw to my fellow Comic Book Clubbers. I was originally going to choose [Dracula Motherfucker](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/dracula-motherf-ker) - yet another Image book! - but I had a suspicion that people almost expected me to pick it, probably due to its sweary title.

_So I didn’t._

And that’s when I stumbled on a Kickstarter for the sequel to Manu, [Puno](https://gustaffovargas.bigcartel.com/product/puno-altiplano-vol-2-pre-order). The Kickstarter still had a few weeks to run but the creator, Gustavo Vargas, had already self-published a number of books.

What the heck, I thought - we’ll read _these_ instead!

The easiest way to get hold of the books - Manu and two previous books; Trujillo and Lima - was to go direct to the artist himself. Originally I only intended to get Manu but for about **£15** I realised I could grab a bundle of all three books. Sounds like a bargain.

I think Tom was a little more au fait with the indie world and snapped up all 3. Jake followed suit but went digital instead. Finally Kelvin grabbed his copies (after a slight shipping mixup that left him with an extra artists sketchbook to boot).

## The rule of three

So we all had the same three books. However, it appears we all had very different ideas about the order in which we should be reading them. 

Kelv started with Manu as it said Volume 1 on the cover. He was intrigued by the potential of cyborg jaguars and was excited to get stuck in.

> “When they all started talking it went downhill from there”<br/>
> Kelvin

Unfortunately Kelv found himself struggling with the slightly stilted and unnatural ‘Hardboiled’ language. Even though the art was cool he just couldn’t find a connection with any of the characters.

So he moved on to Lima. And immediately had a better experience - the story made more sense, the art was just as kinetic and visually appealing and the writing felt smoother and more accomplished. Kelv still couldn’t completely figure out what was going on.

And finally Trujillo. Sadly Kelv gave up on this one. It just didn’t click for him.

## The Kelvin sequence

Tom also read the books in what I am now calling the ‘Kelvin sequence’:

1. Manu
1. Lima
1. Trujillo

Happily Tom’s experience was a lot more positive, taking the non-linear nature of the reading sequence as a narrative structure akin to Pulp Fiction, where past details get filled in at a later date.

> “Has everyone read these in a totally different order?”<br/>
> Tom

Tom was the first, but not the last, to pick up on the 2000ad-ness of the setting, art and writing. It definitely feels like all three books might’ve been written with an 8-page episodic structure in mind. They’d look right at home in a prog nestled between Dredd and Strontium Dog.

Tom had fewer issues with story and dialogue than Kelv, relishing the hard-edged, profanity-laden back and forth between the various protagonists. He too felt like Trujillo was the weakest of the three books, with a definite sense of the creator finding their feet and starting to shape a really interesting world.

⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 
>“I’m really rooting for the guy as a creator. Really happy to have found him!”

## Smash cuts and non-linear narratives

Jake completely disregarded the Kelvin sequence reading Lima first, then Manu and finishing up with Trujillo.

He was taken with the world building from the off and loved Lima’s pacey, exciting street-level first act. He thought the violence was particularly shocking and found some of the cinematic tricks employed later on in the book to be particularly effective.

> “Loved the smash cut to the torture scene”<br/>
> Jake

Getting to the end of Lima Jake’s hopes were high. Then he went on to Manu and, in his words “It was like a totally different book to me”. Jake made it part way through before he realised that the two books were connected. Although the threads were a little clearer he felt as though things had jumped a little too far forward. He wasn’t interested in the distant, damaged girl from Lima - he wanted more techno-street-gods, corporate espionage and cyber-squids!

Unfortunately this meant that Jake didn’t make it through Trujillo either. There was too much guns and gangs for him. Jake don’t do crime.

Jake purchased the digital versions of the books and was full of praise for the art, and in particular the colour, on his iPad. 

⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 
>“I look forward to seeing the art with a story that isn’t his own”

## It's a love story really

So finally we get to me. I chose to read the books in what I understood to be the ‘proper’ order - Trujillo, Lima & Manu. I couldn’t tell you where I got that order from.

The first thing that hit me was that the setting is pretty cool. It’s maybe not quite as unique as I first thought but I get some hefty Shadowrun RPG vibes from the mix of tech and ‘magic. There was also an issue of Alan Moore’s Tom Strong that featured cyber-Aztecs.

I enjoyed both Trujillo and Lima as books in their own right. Both books were easy to read IMHO and were weird and creepy enough to keep my interest all the way through. I love the Cronenberg-y animal-computer interfaces and was desperate to see more or those kind of stuff.

I too really enjoyed the art. It reminds me of Nick Pitarra’s work on the Manhattan Projects - full of slightly exaggerated forms and gangly poses. It really worked for me. There’s definitely a sense of progression with the art between all three books and I think Gustav is only going to get better and better.

And so finally I get to Manu&hellip;

Manu is mostly a very simple story about a vaguely complex relationship. It hinges on the classic “Why don’t we ever stay at my place?” question. It took me a while to really pull together the threads from the previous books but once I got there I enjoyed the fact that the story was building up over a longer time period.

It definitely feels like the most recent of the books and the subtle change in tone, language and structure is a little off-putting. That doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy it though.

## TL;DR

There’s a lot of great stuff in these three books. The art is sharp, clean and dynamic and is backed up by some fascinating world building that may yet pay greater dividends in upcoming volumes. The format is tight and delightfully well put together. I think we’re all interested to see what Mr Vargas does next :-)
