Jake hosted a double dip for our Christmas bonanza. We even feasted together for a Christmas meal for the occasion. The two books were Vertigo Pop's Tokyo Days, Bangkok Nights featuring art by Seth Fisher. This was followed up by Klaus, a festive tale by Grant Morrison.

Jake's [full write-up](http://tygertale.com/2015/12/19/klaus-by-grant-morrison/) can be found on his lovely website as part of his Christmas Advent Calendar series of posts.
