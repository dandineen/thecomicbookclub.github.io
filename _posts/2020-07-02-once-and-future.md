It's been done to death.

From Excalibur, Monty Python and the Holy Grail to Merlin and that recent travesty with Clive Owen, reinventions, reinterpretations and reworkings of the legend of King Arthur are everywhere. This doesn't stop people wanting to put their own unique spin on things, mixing up old tropes with modern thinking and new ideas. The latest author to take a bash is Kieron Gillen, creator of Wicked & Divine, Die, Dr Aphra. 

His take? Arthur's dead. What'd happen if someone brought him back? Sounds like a fairly cool idea. Let's run with it.

# The Gillen effect

I think we all approached Once & Future with no small amount of trepidation. The concerns mainly sprang from Gillen's propensity for littering his writing with self-aggrandising, smug cultural references. We’d all read his work prior to this, and each of us had fairly strong opinions on his style and approach. Mr Gillen is a pretty 'Marmite' kind of guy.

However it appeared the worst of his sensibilities have been toned down here, making Once & Future probably the most accessible work he’s done, perhaps aside from his work on various Marvel Star Wars series.

“Gillen’s writing is far less obnoxious in this” - Tom

# Pendragon meets the X-Men

Most of us had less baggage when it comes to the artist on Once and Future, Dan Mora. He’s a talented, dynamic artist with a style hewn directly from mainstream Marvel superhero books. He draws clean lines, with a hint of manga styling in his pointy faces. There's no doubt this guy can draw.

“Utterly mainstream. But I like that!” - Kelv 

Although the art is of a highly polished quality I can’t help but feel, for me at least, it was a case of “the wrong man in the wrong place”. It was the strange tonal combination that didn’t work for me. I couldn't shake the cognitive dissonance of the city of Bath rendered like New York. I just didn't buy in to it.

The other guys could see my point but they were more admiring of Mora’s art than I. Kelv loved it, Jake thought it was “perfect” and Tom rated it too.

# Colour me impressed

In the book Moras crisp line work is supported by a really rather glorious colour palette by Tamra Bonvillain. Both Tom and Kelv were reminded of Dave Higgin’s original colour palette for The Killing Joke (before Bolland re-coloured it all) - earthy browns, greens and greys shot through with neon and some genuinely lovely, subtle lighting effects. It's some wonderful work and lifts the art to another level.

# Tell me a (new) story

But what of the story itself? Thankfully it wasn’t yet another retelling of the grail story for which I am eternally grateful. What we get is a pretty frenetic chase story set around a (fairly recognisable) Bath, Bristol and the South West UK and filled with zombies, mythical creatures, secrets societies and grandparents with dark secrets. However, both Gillens writing and Moras art end up making anything Brit feel like its been smoothed out, tidied and streamlined. It’s like the world of Once & Future has been dialled down for a more pop-culture audience. That bothered me for some reason. More on that later.

“If you were American you’d love this” - Jake 

Anyway, It’s definitely on the light and frothy side of things, with a pulpy twist to the old stories but sticking pretty close to the unknowingly destined for greatness line that gets regularly spun out in comics.

The protagonist, Duncan, is a pretty bland lead being a bizarre mix of rugby-player build and geeky glasses. I assume this was to give him a Clark Kent level of dorkiness.

His hardcore, gun-toting grandma is a tad more interesting as is the zombified, vampiric ultra-nationalist King Arthur. Arthur’s inherent racist tendencies are something not touched upon very often and it’s here where Gillen does manage to land a fair few good lines including Arthur’s realisation that modern Britain isn’t quite as ‘pure’ of bloodline as he expected when brought back from the dead. Watching Arthur spit out Saxon blood with disgust is a particular hilight!

# Short shrift on the woman-front

Aside from Gran, the other female characters are really rather disappointing. Duncans super-smart botched date (Her name) is utterly wasted, relegated to some kind of decorative candelabra and fobbed off with a statement pretty akin to 'This is really important. Just do it and don’t argue'. Gillen also gives us yet another flavour of sexy fascist (see The sexy nazi trope) which just seems a bit lazy from the guy who gave us the awesomely nihilistic Dr Aphra. 

The biggest problem for me, and it *is* a problem for a number of reasons, is that while reading Once & Future I couldn’t let go of the feeling that I’d read something similar, and better, very recently. Injection - by Ellis, Shalvey & Bellaire - covers so many of the same subjects as Once & Future but eclipses it with such a sense of foreboding and dread it’s hard not to just dismiss O&F as populist fluff. Jake had picked up on the Injection thing too, while Tom had found some parallels with Matt Wagner’s Mage, which we read a while back.

Once & Future isn’t going to save Britain. It’s most certainly not going to save the comic industry. However, if you like your ancient Brit-Myth action spiced up with some US-style superhero flash bang then you probably wont go too wrong with Once & Future. I just wish it was a bit... dirtier.

Kelv & Tom - 4 stars
Dan & Jake - 3 stars
